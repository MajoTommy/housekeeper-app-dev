# CURSOR RULES

- Only do coding in increments and provide testing instructions after each code change. 
- If you are don't have the context of the entire project, take a moment to read the [README.md](README.md)
- Never make changes to the UX or UI without asking first.  Always reference the [UI.md](UI.md) styles and colors when making changes or ask if you want to change them. If we change them please request to update the documentation. 
- Everytime we make changes to the database when building and coding, please ask to update the [DATABASE-STRUCTURE.md](DATABASE-STRUCTURE.md) file.
