# Next Steps

Based on the current progress, here are the recommended next steps:

1.  **Implement Housekeeper Cancellation:** 
    *   Add "Cancel" button to housekeeper schedule for confirmed bookings.
    *   Create a similar cancellation modal (HTML & JS) in the housekeeper interface.
    *   Create a `cancelBookingByHousekeeper` Cloud Function (or modify `cancelBooking` to handle both roles with proper authorization based on caller UID vs `housekeeperId`).
    *   Update housekeeper JS to call the cancellation function.

2.  **Notifications:** Implement notifications (e.g., email or in-app) when a booking is requested, confirmed, or cancelled.
    *   Requires setting up Firebase Cloud Messaging or integrating an email service.
    *   Cloud Functions would trigger these notifications based on Firestore document changes (onCreate, onUpdate for bookings).

3.  **Improve Error Handling/UI Feedback:** 
    *   Provide more specific user feedback for various error conditions (e.g., network errors vs. permission errors).
    *   Enhance loading states during Cloud Function calls.
    *   Refine the UI/UX of modals and drawers.

4.  **Testing:** Thoroughly test all user flows:
    *   Homeowner booking and cancellation.
    *   Housekeeper confirmation and cancellation.
    *   Edge cases (e.g., trying to book past slots, cancelling already cancelled bookings).
    *   Test different timezones.

5.  **Deployment & Monitoring:**
    *   Set up Tailwind CSS build process for production (remove CDN link).
    *   Regularly deploy updates.
    *   Monitor Cloud Function logs and performance in the Firebase console.
    *   Review Firestore rules for security.

6.  **Code Cleanup & Refactoring:**
    *   Review code for potential improvements, consistency, and adherence to best practices.
    *   Consolidate any duplicated utility functions.
